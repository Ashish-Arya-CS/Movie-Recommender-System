# Movie-Recommender-System
A recommender system, or a recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications.I have tried to build such models via two approach.First one using cosine similarity and the other one using SVD algorithm available in scikit learn.
